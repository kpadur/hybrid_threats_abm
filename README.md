## Hybrid threats

Hybrid threats increasingly target civilians through coordinated exploitation of vulnerabilities across domains to undermine their trust in authorities and cause social unrest.
To address such threats, it is useful to understand the adversary's behaviour.
The research presents a novel agent-based model in which agents use reinforcement learning to make decisions.
Using this model, the research studies the behavioural strategies of threat agents with individual and hybrid attack capabilities as well as their impact on the behaviours and opinions of other agents.
While previous research has mainly focused on specific individual threats, this research also demonstrates the learning behaviour of an attacker with hybrid attack capabilities.
Such adaptive behaviour can be particularly challenging for other agents to detect.
Now, relevant detection and response mechanisms can be developed to limit the potential impact of attacks in the future.
